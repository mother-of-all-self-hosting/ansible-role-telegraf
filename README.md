# Telegraf Ansible Role

[Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/) is a self-hosted time-series database. This role helps you to set up Telegraf:

- with everything run in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers
- powered by [the official Telegraf container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/telegraf/)

## Prerequisits

* A installed and running [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/).


## Installing

To configure and install Telegraf on your own server(s), you should use a playbook like [Mother of all self-hosting](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook) or write your own.

## Configuring this role for your playbook

This role depends on a InfluxDB configuring Telegraf. You need to obtain the influx token and config link in the InfluxDB.
In your browser, visit the InfluxDB and go to Load Data -> Telegraf.
There you need to add a Telegraf configuraion. You can now obtain these values from the setup instructions and oaste them here.

```yaml
telegraf_enabled: true
telegraf_influx_token: SUPERSECRETTOKEN
telegraf_config_link: https://influxdb.example.com/api/v2/telegrafs/01234569
```

## Usage

In your InfluxDB configure the Telegraf plugins as you like.
